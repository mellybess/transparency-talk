### A little about me
![transparency 003](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916848/4247728c-a07b-11e6-8ed2-fca054f99dc5.jpeg)

I have a background in government and worked in the office of the CIO in an agency that was going through culture and organizational transformation.
- Moving from siloed structure (multiple verticals each with their own intranet, network team, application team, infrastructure team, budget, etc.) to a shared services model
- Worked on uniform process for project management
- Worked on a legacy web presence migration project
- Saw a lot of instances where bringing transparency to different areas was painful, but unearthed important information for making progress

I moved to GitHub as a Solutions Engineer, where I have the privilege of getting to work with customers who are looking at GitHub as a way to begin innersource, ramp up their open sourcing efforts, and often help them advance transparency initiatives. I work with large organizations in the public and private sectors.

### What is GitHub
![transparency 004](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916849/4247c0d4-a07b-11e6-8b5c-ea155bd4a7b1.jpeg)

### GitHub facts

### GitHub in Government
![transparency 006](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916853/425e2fae-a07b-11e6-86f5-2e47b1aadb22.jpeg)

Many agencies across the :earth_africa: use GitHub, but my familiarity is mostly with organizations in the US government. We have customers who solely use GitHub Enterprise for internal purposes and some who only use GitHub.com for open source projects, and many with both.

### Why Government Agencies Adopt GitHub?
![transparency 007](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916854/425ebb0e-a07b-11e6-912a-7109f487bff2.jpeg)

The circle graph here is from Nasa's JPL and is a representation of teams participating in other team's projects once they introduced GitHub Enterprise. Increasing transparency and collaboration is often at the top of the list for government agencies moving to GitHub. I have the privilege of speaking to some of these groups as they progress through their transformations.

### Types of transparency
![transparency 008](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916857/425fab68-a07b-11e6-87a7-024fce98635b.jpeg)

### Types of transparency: Inside a department
![transparency 009](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916856/425eda94-a07b-11e6-9f2d-fb10d573620c.jpeg)

Being unable to find information, the right domain expert, or the state of projects around your organization is a barrier to getting work done.

Transparency inside a department means making it easy to find that information, which benefits individuals in a department at well as the projects they work on.

Communicating transparently (in writing, somewhere linkable) reduces the "you had to be there" problem, discussed in Ben Balter's [15 Rules for communicating at GitHub](http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/)

> Asynchronous communication through high-fidelity mediums like issues and chat eliminate the endemic “you had to be there” aspect of most corporate workflows, and reduces the need for a dedicated management class to capture, collect, and shuttle information back and forth between business units. You could have the best tools in the world, but without the necessary social norms, you’re setting yourself up for failure.

While you don't need to go as far as to eliminate all managers, teams and departments can benefit from having a searchable place to find status, context, and roadmaps for projects that might relevant to them as opposed to having to join meetings or email lists.

### Types of transparency: Between departments
![transparency 010](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916855/425ec9c8-a07b-11e6-8c57-e3d98b75a402.jpeg)

Departments in the same regions, working with similar populations, or on similar issues across regions are often tackling similar problems in different ways. Having access to data, current projects, and teams focused on certain initiatives has the potential to provide better services.

An analogy here is open source: people across departments are trying to solve the same problems on their own. There are a lot of efforts to cross-pollinate best practices, successful projects, etc. across departments. Creating ways to make the work done in one department open to others could lower the barrier to this cross-pollination and increase collaboration.

### Types of transparency: With Constituents
![transparency 011](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916862/428499e6-a07b-11e6-844d-4052f93e6fed.jpeg)

Records requests, public hearings, etc. exist to bring transparency and participation between agencies and constituents. But it can still be hard to:
- access information,
- figure out what services agencies provide,
- get access to services
- understand what is going on inside a department (unless you can make it public meetings or read the annual report.)

Being transparent with constituents can mean
- make it easy to search for information and services.
- make it easy to figure out what is currently going on in a department and how to get involved
- increasing civic engagement, even for those who can't make it to a Tuesday night public forum

### Opportunities: SF Business Portal
![transparency 012](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916861/428441f8-a07b-11e6-90c5-d99e1a28303d.jpeg)

The SF Business Portal is a great example of cross department and external transparency. This award winning website, coordinated and built by the CCSF Department of Technology was buily to organize information that potential SF business owners need in order to open different types of businesses.

It's purpose was two-fold though
- Help people figure what they need to do to open a business (what permits are needed, what steps to take, what resources are available)
- Show at a high level how complicated it is to open a business in SF. For instance opening a restaurant requires 21 permits across 12 local, state, and federal agencies. The majority are local.

The permits were developed in silos, and the holistic result is...it is pretty hard to get a business off up and running. By shining a light on these processes, the city can start to figure out how to streamline and encourage new businesses.

The interface is modern, visual, and at its heart designed to make it easy for people to find the information they need.

### Opportunities: City of Bloomington Website
![transparency 013](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19950613/c9232f4a-a115-11e6-9a61-8355f41486d7.jpeg)

The City of Bloomington Indiana is doing some awesome stuff!

One example is their website redesign. The [current version](https://bloomington.in.gov/) is a familiar looking government website: lots of information, not necessarily modern, difficult to see where to go for information

The are redesigning the website and have an [alpha  version](https://bloomington.in.gov/alpha/) that they are soliciting public feedback on via a Google form. A great example of showing the public what work is being done and allowing them to weigh in asynchronously.

### Opportunities: City of Bloomington uReport
![transparency 014](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916859/428249d4-a07b-11e6-9bb9-861c41d9cd58.jpeg)

Another gem from Bloomington is their [uReport application](https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/uReport). This is a app to allow residents to report issues (like 311), and it's open source on GitHub. So residents and other departments can see what they are building, weight in and even contribute.

This is a tool that is useful outside of Bloomington. Making this software open source on GitHub.com mean *potentially* other cities can make a copy of it and either use it directly, or customize it to their needs, and contribute back to make the software better. As opposed to building and maintaining their own from scratch.

### Opportunities: Federal Source Code Policy
![transparency 015](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19916858/4281c932-a07b-11e6-8485-1176b29b052a.jpeg)

The Federal Source Code policy is another example of both working in a transparent way on a project...which is about transparency. The policy itself is hosted on GitHub and the public can open issues to discuss the policy with it's maintainers, and open pull requests to edit the policy.

### Modeling Transparency
![transparency016](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19950560/84397d26-a115-11e6-8001-d67ece447c03.jpeg)

Even if a project isn't centered around collaborating with other departments or constituents, you can still model transparency in the work you do, to bring that into your department.

The idea of modeling modern software practices in government agencies and comapnies is proven to work (18F, Thoughtworks, Pivotal Labs) and modeling transparency is similar.

By working on your stuff out in the open, making it easy for others to find resources and, you can start to show the value of transparency.

Also, it can save you time and make you look super smart and together when people ask you questions.

### Tools for transparency
![transparency017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19950561/8439c4f2-a115-11e6-9276-bbcee68343a2.jpeg)

Tools that don't facilitate transparency:
- hand written notes
- phone calls
- status meetings with sparse notes
- Word documents saved to your PC or personal drive

...and many others

Tools that encourage transparency
- Public chat rooms/channels: give your conversations a link!
- GitHub
- Well organized/web based shared drives...again, give everything a link.

Key tenants:
- is it linkable?
- Is it searchable?

Bonus points:
- Can you see how it is changed over time?
- Can you see who changed it?
- Can you see the context behind the change?

### Inclusive conversations
![transparency018](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19950559/8438efe6-a115-11e6-9806-62e7982345b0.jpeg)

Having conversations in the open (in chat, GitHub issues, etc.) means that:
- People can do their own research on a topic by searching conversations before calling you
- Less chance of leaving someone off the email thread/out of the loop


### Communication
![transparency019](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19950562/843a4c42-a115-11e6-81fc-f34e0aa74959.jpeg)

Con't

- you can link back to those conversations
- passive means of keeping other up to date (or keeping up to date yourself)

Chatrooms and teams on GitHub also has the benefit of removing the burden of having to know exactly who to reach out to. Find a chat channel/room with a likely name and ask your question. @mention a GitHub team with a likely name and ask for help/input.

### Documentation
![transparency020](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8127456/19950563/843bb60e-a115-11e6-80d7-6d0cf71f7620.jpeg)

Get important conversations related to particular topics out of email, off the phone, and into writing, somewhere linkable, searchable and easy to find close to the project it's about. In my biased opinion, GitHub is the right place for this. But even links to relevant documents, chat channels, and other sources on an intranet page would get people off to a good start.
