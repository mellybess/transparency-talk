### A little about me

I have a background in government and worked in the office of the CIO in an agency that was going through culture and prganizational transformation.
- Moving from siloed structure (multiple verticals each with their own intranet, network team, application team, infrastructure team, budget, etc.) to a shared services model
- Worked on uniform process for project managment
- Worked on a legacy web presence migration project
- Saw a lot of instances where bringing transparency to different areas was painful, but unearthed important information for making progress

I moved to GitHub as a Solutions Engineer, where I have the priviledge of getting to work with customers who are looking at GitHub as a way to begin innersource, ramp up their open sourcing efforts, and often help them advance transparency initiatives. I work with large organizations in the public and private sectors.

### What is GitHub

### GitHud in Government

Many agencies across the :earth: use GitHub, but my familiarity is mostly with organizations in the US government. We have customers who solely use GitHub Enterprise for internal purposes and some who only use GitHub.com for open source projects, and many with both.

### Why Government Agencies Adopt GitHub?

The circle graph here is from Nasa's JPL and is a representation of teams participating in other team's projects once they introduced GitHub Enterprise. Increasing transparency and collaboration is often at the top of the list for government agencies moving to GitHub. I have the priviledge of speaking to some of these groups as they progress through their transformations.

### Types of transparency
