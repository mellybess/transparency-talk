## Purpose

The point of this repository is to host the slides from a talk I gave on transparency for future reference. A markdown file of the talk is [here](https://github.com/mellybess/transparency-talk/blob/master/talk.md) and downloads are available [here](https://github.com/mellybess/transparency-talk/releases/tag/1) in a few flavors.
